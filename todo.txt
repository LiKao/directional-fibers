code:
    non rnn example
    rnn wrappers for solvers
    combo solver
    for local and combo, smarter termination criteria (e.g., time since last new fixed point >= time to last new fixed point, after many points found)
    more graceful error handling for critical directions (Baram email)
    forward error everywhere instead of tolerances
    log files
        find a home for hardwrite (not numerical)
        Logger class? hardwrite, and tracks indentation
        also handles timing?
    repetitions in tests with multiple W
    "performance" tests: not asserts, but how often things are within expected tolerances, good statuses, etc

research:
    does magnitude of alpha (or alpha') relate to svd (for global bound)?
    svd is ~n^3?  check that this dominates large N, and then try to just lower bound in < n^3 instead of compute exactly

experiments:
    reproduce last paper?
    how often is there single c to rule them all?
        keep sampling fibers until one finds all fixed points - both known by construction, and found by previous samples
        statistics on # points in fibers (not so different from last paper)
        patterns determining single c?
        patterns bounding min fiber svd?
    combo method:
        comparison with fiber, local
        empirical characterization of fiber topologies
        typical rate of new points being found
