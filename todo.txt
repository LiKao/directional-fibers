code:
    rnn wrappers for solvers
    more graceful error handling for critical directions (Baram email)
    forward error everywhere instead of tolerances
    log files
        find a home for hardwrite (not numerical)
        Logger class? hardwrite, and tracks indentation
        also handles timing?
    repetitions in tests with multiple W
    "performance" tests: not asserts, but how often things are within expected tolerances, good statuses, etc
research:
    does magnitude of alpha (or alpha') relate to svd (for global bound)?
    svd is ~n^3?  check that this dominates large N, and then try to just lower bound in < n^3 instead of compute exactly
