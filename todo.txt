repetitions in tests with multiple W
"performance" tests: not asserts, but how often things are within expected tolerances, good statuses, etc
forward error for convergence criteria
find a home for hardwrite (not numerical)
check fxpt locations of traversal
Users sub-class DynamicalSystem object? with fDf, compute_step_size, etc
svd is ~n^3?  check that this dominates large N, and then try to just lower bound in < n^3 instead of compute exactly
